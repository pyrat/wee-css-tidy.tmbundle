The bundle is hosted on github. It uses the excellent "CSStidy project":http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/ behind the scenes so make sure that you have php installed on your machine as CLI.  > version 5.

Ctrl + alt + option + c will beautify your css file that you have open in the browser. It assumes that you are using 2 spaces for a tab instead of tab characters. So make sure you are using soft tabs in your code.
